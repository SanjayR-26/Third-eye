India, where a third of the world’s blind people reside, has about 12 million blind people, especially in comparison to a total of 39 million worldwide, according to the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB). Visually challenged people, including children and elderly people with low vision, still have trouble performing everyday tasks, even in this world of rapidly developing technologies. The existing solutions provide a straight forward solution using Artificial Intelligence technologies. To take this technological solution to the next level we propose a solution with all the AI features seamlessly integrated together and a dedicated mobile application gives full control and independency to their life. The A-Eye (smart glasses) system that is being proposed consists of a wearable smart glass solution, a mobile application, and a cloud-based data management platform. This project shows how Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can be used to process data on the mobile phone other than to process the camera’s video stream in the cloud or locally at the system level. The project’s use of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) expands the scope of its ability to add and update an endless number of features without being constrained by hardware. Therefore, the suggested smart glass system can minimize latency and be highly scalable while using heavy and effective models to effectively mitigate the problem and assist visually challenged individuals.

- Developed Third-Eye, user-friendly AI goggles for visually impaired individuals. Integrated advanced technologies like Object Detection, Facial detection & Recognition, Currency recognition, Edge computing, Speech and Gesture Recognition
- Implemented Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) in Third-Eye, reducing latency and enabling scalability. Seamlessly processed data on the mobile device, improving assistance for visually challenged individuals.
- Created a comprehensive solution with a dedicated mobile app and cloud-based platform, empowering visually impaired individuals with independence and control over daily tasks.
